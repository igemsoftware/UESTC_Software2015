# MCCAP

Construction of the smallest cell is a great project in synthetic biology. MCCAP(Minimal Cell Construct and Analyse Panel) is an engineering drawing to construct the smallest cell. You can select the appropriate species in the MCCAP to generate the corresponding minimal set of genes and other relevant data.

## Environment

#### Operating environment
* Windows XP of higher
* Linux 64 bit

#### Development environment
* Windows
* Qt 5.5.0
* MinGW_32

## Installation

### Windows
Download MCCAP.zip and decompression it, just run the exe file.

### Linux
Download MCCAP.tar.gz.

    tar -zxvf MCCAP.tar.gz
    ./MCCAP.sh

## Features

### Reference species select
This is the first part of MCCAP, and all the work of constructing  a minimal cell start from here. User can choose appropriate reference species according to their own needs. You can choose species(at least 4) which you wanted by pull them to right side or double clicking them.

### Minimal gene set display
The minimal set is divided into four part, you can download it in csv format. MCCAP will alse produce the result of pathway and module at the same time.

### Gene network display
Click pathway or module bubble  then you can see the details of gene network. All genes that are involved in minimal gene set are marked with red.

### Compare results
Every time you select the cell, you can save the selected results. Checked two sets of records in historical records and clicked on the Compare Button, and the comparison results are obtained.

### Analysis of assembly
For researchers aiming to bring their design into reality, MCCAP provides informations related to assembly and standard parts. So that users can decide which certain gene to use and how to process this gene into a standard part.
